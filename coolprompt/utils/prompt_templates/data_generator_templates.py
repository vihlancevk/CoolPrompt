You should create a validation dataset of {num_samples} examples.
Create a set of ground-truth labels.
Then make some test questions (inputs) that correlates with problem description and use created labels as the responses. Try to make the answers distribution more random.
Problem description: {problem_description}
Provide your answer in JSON object with key 'examples' containing a list of your artificial examples. Each example is an object with keys 'input' and 'output' that are contain corresponding text.
Make sure to include all necessary data in 'input' object. You must not add any other objects except 'input' and 'output'.
Also remember that 'input' and 'output' are textual fields. If you have some answer choices for input - just concat them with input text into one string.
Output format is the JSON structure below:
